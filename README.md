# Task 1: Introduction

Welcome to Basic Image Classification with TensorFlow.

This graph describes the problem that we are trying to solve visually. We want to create and train a model that takes an image of a hand written digit as input and predicts the class of that digit, that is, it predicts the digit or it predicts the class of the input image.
